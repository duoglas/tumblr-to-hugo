# Tumblr to Hugo

I didn't want to move a bunch of blog posts manually from Tumblr to Hugo, so I built this.

When you run this, it will create a file per post you have on Tumblr, with the proper title and a path that makes sense (/blog/the-title-of-the-post) and also create a CSV file with the original URL and the new path on Hugo, to help you setup the redirections.

## Run

To run it:
- clone this repo
- run `ruby t2h.rb SOME+API+KEY+HERE my-blog-on.tumblr.com`
- Brag about how fast you did that migration

:tada:

## Q&A
1. Before run:
`gem install httparty pry`

2. fix no title problems: Post without title or no english character.
